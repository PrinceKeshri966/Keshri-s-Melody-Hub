🎵 Keshri Melody Hub
📖 Overview
Keshri Melody Hub is an interactive music playlist application inspired by real-world media players. Built with a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), this project demonstrates the use of a Doubly Linked List to manage songs dynamically — allowing users to add, navigate (next/previous), and delete tracks seamlessly.

💡 Key Features
🎶 Add Songs to your playlist in real-time

⏭️ Move to the Next Song or ⏮️ go back to the Previous Song

🗑️ Delete Songs from anywhere in the playlist

⚙️ Doubly Linked List ensures smooth navigation in both directions

🎧 Clean and responsive user interface

🧠 Data Structure in Focus
This app is powered by a Doubly Linked List, where each node represents a song. It allows:

Forward traversal (next song)

Backward traversal (previous song)

Efficient insertion and deletion at any position

🗂️ Project Structure
index.html – The main HTML file that structures the music hub

styles.css – Provides stylish visuals for an immersive music experience

app.js – Implements playlist logic using the doubly linked list structure

🛠️ Tech Stack
